Dying! It is what humans do. We do, however, attempt to delay this end for as long as possible. We continue to make horrible decisions around risk and death. 

Living means taking risks. With this said, we need a better way to understand risk. We will use micromorts. Luckily this already exists and is helpful to understand and compare risk of death. 

We can use [micromorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort) to help track how risky an activity is and compare it to other activities. This will help us understand what is dangerous and what isn't. 

Micromorts are pretty simple. For instance, living one day at age 20 is *1 micromort*, running a marathon is *7 micromorts*, and riding a motorcycle for 60 miles is *10 micromorts*. We can easily see that riding a motorcycle is more dangerous than running a marathon. 

This is helpful. 

The following is a collection of activities and the micromorts of each activity. You can than compare, understand risks and then make decisions. 

At the bottom of the table is a form where y ou can contribute values for other activities. Let's collect them all.

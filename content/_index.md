Dying! It is what humans do. We do, however, attempt to delay this end for  as long as possible.  

    Humans are really really bad at understanding risk. This is evidenced by decisions such as 1. Betting on a horse 2. Going to Vegas 3. Smoking. 

    Living means taking risks. 

    The only constant is change. Things change. They break. And when they do, they don’t go back to how they were. 

    There is no such thing as “perfect.” No object or person is perfect.

With this said, we need a better way to understand risk. We will use micromorts. Luckily this already exists and is helpful to understand and compare risk of death.
